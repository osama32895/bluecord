## Installing / Uninstalling

If you're just a normal user, use [our simple gui installer!](https://github.com/Vendicated/VencordInstaller#usage)

If you're a power user who wants to contribute and make plugins or just want to build from source and install manually, read [Megu's Installation Guide!](docs/1_INSTALLING.md)

## Installing on Browser

Install the browser extension for [![Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/chrome-ext-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/releases/latest/download/Vencord-for-Chrome-and-Edge.zip), [![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/firefox-ext-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/releases/latest/download/Vencord-for-Firefox.xpi) or [UserScript](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/releases/download/devbuild/Vencord.user.js). Please note that they aren't automatically updated for now, so you will regularely have to reinstall it.


You may also build them from source, to do that do the same steps as in the manual regular install method,
except run `pnpm buildWeb` instead of `pnpm build`, and your outputs will be in the dist folder

```sh
pnpm buildWeb
```

You will find the built extension at dist/extension.zip. Now just install this extension in your Browser

## Installing Plugins

> **Note**
> You can only use 3rd party plugins in the manual bluecord install for now.

bluecord comes with a bunch of plugins out of the box!

However, if you want to install your own ones, create a `userplugins` folder in the `src` directory and create or clone your plugins in there.
Don't forget to rebuild!

Want to learn how to create your own plugin, and maybe PR it into bluecord? See the [Contributing](#contributing) section below!
